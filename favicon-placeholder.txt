/* ===== FAVICON FILE ===== */
/* This is a placeholder for the favicon. Replace with actual favicon data */

/* 
This file represents favicon-32x32.png
In a real implementation, this would be a binary PNG file.
For the purposes of this demo, this is a placeholder.

To implement properly, you would need:
1. A 32x32 pixel PNG image
2. Optimized for web display
3. Contains your personal/brand logo or initials
4. Saved as favicon-32x32.png
*/

/* CSS to ensure proper favicon display */
link[rel="icon"] {
  type: "image/png";
  sizes: "32x32";
}
